## R CMD check results: No errors nor warnings 
# and no problems with revdepchecks.  

# 5 platforms on GitHub Actions: 
# Win and macOS (release) plus 
# ubuntu (devel, release & oldrel):
# macOS (release) complained, "Error: ...MASS: Needs R >= 4.3". 
# We don't know how to fix that problem. 
# The other checks all came back clean.
